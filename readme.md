# LeetCode Solutions

This project includes solutions to LeetCode problems, organized into the `top-150` directory. Each file contains a Python implementation of a specific problem.

## File Structure

```
└── top-150
    ├── best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii.py
    ├── best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.py
    ├── jump-game.py
    ├── majority-element.py
    ├── merge-sorted-array.py
    ├── remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii.py
    ├── remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array.py
    ├── remove-element.py
    └── rotate-array.py
```

## Usage

To use this project, you can run any of the Python files in the `top-150` directory. Each file contains a `Solution` class with a method that solves a specific LeetCode problem.

For example, to run the `remove-element.py` file, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```
python3 top-150/remove-element.py
```

This will run the `removeElement` method in the `Solution` class and print the result to the console.

## Testing

This project includes unit tests for each solution. The tests are located in the same file as the solution and use the `unittest` module. To run the tests for a specific solution, you can use the following command:

```
python3 top-150/<filename>.py
```

This will run the tests in the `TestSolution` class and print the results to the console.
